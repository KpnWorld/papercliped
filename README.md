# Papercliped

**Run your [Paperclip](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip) from any AI app.** Papercliped connects Claude, ChatGPT, Codex and any MCP app to your Paperclip, the open-source orchestrator for companies of AI agents. Check on agents, pause or wake them, assign issues, decide approvals and get status, cost and activity reports, without opening the dashboard.

## Add it to your AI app

You need a Paperclip with a public `https` address ([no domain? see this](https://docs.papercliped.co/connect-your-paperclip)). The first time you connect, you approve the request inside your own Paperclip, pick a username, save the secret key you're shown once, and choose **Read only** or **Full control**.

The connector address for every app is:

```
https://mcp.papercliped.co/mcp
```

### Claude (web, desktop and mobile)

**Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector**, paste `https://mcp.papercliped.co/mcp`, then **Connect**.

### Claude Code

Install the plugin (adds the tools, a Paperclip skill and `/paperclip-status`, `/paperclip-sync`, `/paperclip-report`):

```
/plugin marketplace add OpenSourcx/papercliped
/plugin install papercliped@papercliped
```

Or just the MCP server:

```sh
claude mcp add --transport http paperclip https://mcp.papercliped.co/mcp
```

Then run `/mcp` to sign in.

### Codex

Install the plugin:

```sh
codex plugin marketplace add OpenSourcx/papercliped
codex plugin add papercliped@papercliped
```

Or just the MCP server (Codex starts the sign-in for you):

```sh
codex mcp add paperclip --url https://mcp.papercliped.co/mcp
```

### ChatGPT

Turn on **Developer mode** (Settings → Apps → Advanced settings), choose **Create app**, paste `https://mcp.papercliped.co/mcp` and pick OAuth. Menu names change often; the [ChatGPT guide](https://docs.papercliped.co/chatgpt) has the current steps and the Custom GPT (Actions) option.

### Any other MCP app

Add a remote MCP server (Streamable HTTP, OAuth) at `https://mcp.papercliped.co/mcp`. See [Any AI app](https://docs.papercliped.co/other-ai-apps).

### Paperclip on your own machine (no public address)

Run Papercliped locally instead. It talks straight to your Paperclip; nothing goes through papercliped.co. Use a Paperclip **board** token (agent keys can't pause or approve):

```sh
# Claude Code
claude mcp add paperclip --env PAPERCLIP_API_URL=http://localhost:3100 --env PAPERCLIP_API_KEY=<board token> -- npx -y papercliped@latest

# Codex
codex mcp add paperclip --env PAPERCLIP_API_URL=http://localhost:3100 --env PAPERCLIP_API_KEY=<board token> -- npx -y papercliped@latest
```

Add `--env PAPERCLIP_READ_ONLY=1` for reports and sync only.

## What you can ask

- "What are my agents working on?" · "Which agents are over budget?"
- "Pause the Web Engineer." · "Wake the CEO and assign it the onboarding issue."
- "Approve the hire request." · "Weekly cost report, please."

There are 30 tools ([full list](https://docs.papercliped.co/tools)). **Read only** can look at agents, issues, goals, costs and reports. **Full control** can use every tool. The AI asks before anything that can't be undone, and you can change the level or disconnect at any time.

## Manage your connections in Paperclip

Install the **Papercliped plugin for Paperclip** (npm `papercliped-paperclip-plugin`, from **Settings → Plugins** in Paperclip). It adds a **control room**: see every connected app, choose which tools each may use and which agents it applies to, set **API only / Full / Agent only** for every agent or one at a time (or turn an agent off), read what was blocked, go anonymous, and look after your account. [Plugin guide](https://docs.papercliped.co/paperclip-plugin) · [The control room](https://docs.papercliped.co/control-room) · [API only, Full or Agent only](https://docs.papercliped.co/access-modes).

## Security and privacy

- You approve every connection inside your own Paperclip; no passwords pass through Papercliped.
- Levels are enforced by Papercliped on every call, and every call is audit-logged.
- Paperclip keys are encrypted at rest; tokens and secret keys are stored only as one-way hashes.
- Only public `https` Paperclip addresses are reachable from the hosted service.
- No trackers or third-party scripts on the website.

Threat model: [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md). Report a vulnerability: [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). Privacy: [papercliped.co/privacy](https://papercliped.co/privacy).

## Run it yourself

The hosted service runs exactly this code. To host your own (for a team, or to keep everything on your infrastructure), see [Run it yourself](https://docs.papercliped.co/self-hosting), [docs/oauth.md](docs/oauth.md) and the [launch guide](docs/LAUNCH.md) (Render + Supabase, free tiers).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/OpenSourcx/papercliped && cd papercliped
npm install && npm test
